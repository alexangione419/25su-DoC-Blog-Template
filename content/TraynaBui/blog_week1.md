# Week 1 Blog Post

Starting on May 12th, I spent a wonderful first week exploring and traveling in Belgium! By far and one of the most memorable experiences was exploring the Catholic churches of Leuven on the first day of our sightseeing tour. Before this trip, I had seen European churches primarily as architectural monuments or tourist attractions. But as I wandered through Leuven's historic Catholic churchesâ€”like St. Peter's Church in the city center. I was struck by their deep connection to the city's political, cultural, and educational history.

I was surprised to learn that these churches were not just places of worship; they once served as community centers, educational spaces, and even sites of scientific discovery. For example, I didn't realize that Leuven's churches had ties to the university and helped shape the city's intellectual life during the Middle Ages. Hearing how these buildings were damaged and rebuilt after events such as the First World War gave me a deeper appreciation for their role as symbols of resilience and identity.

This trip completely changed my view of Catholic churches in Europe, not as static relics, but as evolving reflections of the communities that surround them. It made me even more curious about how public spaces, especially religious ones, contain stories about the city's past and present.
