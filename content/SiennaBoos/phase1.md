 # Project Phase I

This dialogue has already progressed how I perceive AI’s growing usage and my place in its implementation. Hearing speakers at NATO and the European Commission – the highest levels of political and military decision-making – describe how they are incorporating AI into countless aspects of functioning or pouring funds into it caused the relevancy of AI to truly sink in for me. Given the miraculous combination of AI policy being uncharted territory and AI’s massive breakthrough happening right as I enter college, my peers and I truly have the ability to shape how these tools are utilized in the future – an exceptionally consequential responsibility.

Hearing these speakers has reaffirmed my sense of purpose as I move forward in my career, and I have enjoyed getting to satisfy my intellectual curiosity while also visiting some beautiful places and meeting some great people.

For the Phase I deliverable, I proposed the howtheyvote.eu data source and came up with the idea to center our project around MEP voting patterns and party cohesion. I also wrote the persona and stories for Camila, the political journalist, and edited the other personas. Additionally, I helped write the description with my teammates and formatted the group post in Markdown.
