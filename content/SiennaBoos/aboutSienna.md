# About Sienna Boos

## Hi, my name is **Sienna!**

![Headshot](headshot2.jpeg)

I am origninally from Bucks Country, Pennsylvania, but I am being educated in Boston at Northeastern University. Soon, I will enter my second year here as a Data Science and Behavioral Neuroscience Major and Philosophy minor. My interests and hobbies include genetics, AI, philosophy, science communication, reading, writing/journaling, listening to music, and visiting new coffee shops around Boston.

I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to study the intersection of software and government in a beautiful city like Leuven, Belgium, and contribute to a meaningful data science project!
