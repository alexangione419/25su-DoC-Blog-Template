# Project Phase IV

For phase IV of the project, my individual contributions were:

- Fully developing the logistic regression model - first in a Jupyter Notebook, then reorganizing it into functions in a python file.

- Writing the route for the logistic regression ML model, adding the weights to the database, and coding the UI components of the model.

- Creating the loyalty comparison by party bar graph in the Dissent Predictor page where the ML model is located.

- Coding the dissent overtime graph on the Political Jounalist's "Party Dissent Monitor" page, writing a route to get necessary information for this vizualization from the database, and implementing this page into the frontend.

- General UI cleanup such as changing button and column names to correspond with current application state and adding explanations to pages in order to improve user experience.

One highlight from this week on dialogue was when I went to dinner and dessert with Dr. Gerber and a small group of Dialogue students! The group dinner at Roots was also a great time.

Overall, I am proud what I contributed to this project and extremely grateful for how much I have learned throughout this dialogue. I truly cannot believe that _all of this_ happened in only one month! Before coming here, I didn't even know what a pull request was on GitHub. I am still no expert, but I feel like I have grown so much, not only in technical skills but in solidifying my passion for data science and my confidence as a Khoury Student. My academic growth as well as the memories and relationships I made outside the classroom will stick with me forever. This dialogue will for sure be a highlight of my college experience, and I couldn't be more thankful!
